Library Management System
A web-based application built using Django for managing a digital library. Users can register, log in, and manage a collection of books through CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The system includes user authentication, book reservation with many-to-many relationships, and a responsive interface styled with Bootstrap.

Note: This project was developed as a group project for the IS 424 Web Application Development course at King Saud University.
